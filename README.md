Media Server is a media manipulation library that works inside of your existing applications.  It manages uploads and downloads, and lets you translate files into different encodings on the fly using FFmpeg.  It works primarily with images and audio files, with video manipulations currently under development.

```go

ms := mediaserver.New(originalFilesystem, cacheFilesystem)

if err := ms.Put("myfile", filedata); err != nil {
  // handle error
}

filespec := mediaserver.Filespec{
  Filename: "myfile"
  MimeType: "image/webp"
  Height: 600,
  Width: 600,
}

if err := ms.Get(filespec, result); err != nil {
  // handle error
}

// return result to client...

```

## Image Resizing

Media Server can resize and transcode images. Just request an image with a [FileSpec](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benpate/mediaserver#FileSpec) that matches your needs and the corresponding file will be generated (or retrieved from the cache) and returned to your calling application.

```go
// This filespec resizes an image to 1200px (maintaining aspect ratio)
filespec := mediaserver.Filespec{
  Width:1200,
}
```

## Media Transcoding

Media Server can automatically translate files between these formats:

```go
// This filespec converts an audio file into an MP3
filespec := mediaserver.Filespec{
  MimeType:"audio/mp3"
}
```

**Image Types**: GIF, JPG, PNG, WEBP

**Audio Types**: FLAC, AAC, MP3

**Video Types**: Coming soon

## FFmpeg Dependency

This library now depends on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for all media manipulations.  This eliminated a problematic dependency on CGo, and has expanded the kinds of media files that mediaserver can manipulate.

Media Server maintains two resource directories: one that contains original uploads and a cache of modified or transcoded files.

## Afero Filesystems

Media server uses [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero) to connect to both of the file directories (one for originals, and one for cached results).  Afero is a filesystem abstraction with connectors for many different kinds of directory services, including: 

* local and networked directories
* memory disks
* [S3](https://github.com/fclairamb/afero-s3)
* [HTTP](https://github.com/spf13/afero/blob/master/httpFs.go)
* [Git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git)
* [Dropbox](https://github.com/fclairamb/afero-dropbox)
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://github.com/spf13/afero/tree/master/gcsfs)
* [SFTP](https://github.com/spf13/afero/tree/master/sftpfs)

## Pull Requests Welcome

This library is a work in progress, and will benefit from your experience reports, use cases, and contributions.  If you have an idea for making Rosetta better, send in a pull request.  We're all in this together! ðŸŒ‡
